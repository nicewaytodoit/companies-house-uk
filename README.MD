# UK Companies house API

Hi, please ***DO NOT DOWNLOAD*** this package is not ready yet, and it won't be until version 0.1.0.
Currently, I can work on this project for only a few hours on Sundays.


## Current roadmap
The roadmap is as follows:
- API functions for retrieving data
- Decorating retrieved data with dictionary results 
- TypeScript types for each entity
- ...


## Note
If you have more ideas about other functionalities you would like to see in this npm package or something you would like me to improve; please raise the issue https://github.com/nicewaytodoit/companies-house-uk/issues with the label "feature request".

Thank you,
Aleks
